- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Class component allows for access and control of the Component Lifecycle to create web-applications.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

The constructor create components with inciting state data for the initial render.
The render() returns some piece of DOM and is required for a class component.
The componentDidMount() get called as soon as the render method is called the first time, part of the mounting phase in the React Lifecycle.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

We use custom hooks to create stateful logic for our applications.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing ensures that each part of our application works as intended and integration testing ensures that the parts work together so that we can squash them bugs before they spread.
